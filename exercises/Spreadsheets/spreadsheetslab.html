    <p>3. You should get to <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59">a page that looks like this</a>:</p>

    <p>4. Since this is a big dataset, we're going to filter it to just the New School neighborhood.</p>

    <p>5. Go to the Filter drodown, and add a new filter condition of Zip Code: 10011. Make sure the little checkbox is checked.</p>

    <p>6. Now we're going to export the data to our own computers. Click on Export, and select CSV (who knows what CSV stand for?).</p>

    <p>7. Make a new Google Spreadsheet.</p>

    <p>8. Import the NYC Restaurant Inspection data that we just saved.</p>
            <img src="excelscreen5.jpg">
            <img src="excelscreen6.jpg">
            <p>You should end up with this:</p>
          <img src="excelscreen7.jpg">
    <p>9. Freeze the top row, so that you can see all the headers when you scroll down.</p>
    <img src="excelscreen8.jpg">

    <p>10. Poke around a little bit. What do all the columns mean? </p>
    <p>11. Let's find out for sure. Go to the "About" section, and click on "View Full Page."</p>

    <p>12. Download the 2 attachments. What do the grades mean? What about scores? Is a high or low score better?</p>
        <img src="excelscreendatadictionary.jpg">

    <p>13. Back to our Google spreadsheet. We're going to try to figure out how many restaurants are in each grade category. Click on Data > Pivot Table report.</p>
    <img src="excelscreen9.jpg">
    <p>14. In the Rows section, add Grade. In the Values section, add CAMIS. (Why? What does CAMIS mean? Look back at the data dictionary.)</p>
            <img src="excelscreenpivot.jpg">

    <p>15. Does this give us the answer we need? Why or why not?</p>
    <p>16. Go back and Summarize by COUNTUNIQUE. We also don't need the totals.</p>
            <img src="excelscreen10.jpg">

    <p>17. Chart it! What form would you pick for this data?</p>
            <img src="excelscreen11.jpg">
            <img src="excelscreen12.jpg">

    <p>18. <b>EXTRA:</b> What's the breakdown of restaurants by Score? Use the same strategy to find out and chart your data.</p>
