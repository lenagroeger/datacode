Let's work on this age column. What could it possibly mean???

Here is the explanation:

When the date of birth is not available, the age of the patient must be
entered. For children under two years old, record the age in months.
To show that the age is in months instead of years, put a "2" in the first
space of the age code. Code the age of infants in "completed months;"
e.g., code the age of infants who are four to seven weeks old as one
month. Code the age of infants who are less than one month old as
one month.
Examples:
Age Code
Three weeks 201
Four weeks (one month) 201
Seven weeks 201
Ten weeks 202
Nine months 209
Twelve months (one year) 212
Eighteen months 218
For a patient two years of age or older, record age in years.


Number of Months
=IF(I2>200,(I2-200)&"m",I2)

Years as a Decimal
=IF(I2>200,(I2-200)/12,I2)

Round it!
=IF(I2>200,ROUND((I2-200)/12,0),I2)


Now, what's the Mean?
=AVERAGE(H:H)
Media?
=MEDIAN(H:H)
Mode?
=MODE(H:H)
